# Objective 

Record market data coming from D. broker.

# Pinciples

The quotes are collected with sereral parallel webrequests.
All the deserialized data is added to a single queue which is poped by a unique consumer thread.
This consumer thread - only, and that's why it is unique - routes the data to a per-instrument queue.
When a queue seems ready to be flushed (several crits), the IO thread handling this instrument removes - all or part of - the in-memory data after it got the confirmation the data has been written to the per-instrument file.

The data is store as binary-fixed-size object in file.

# Server

 * Url is /HistoricalData
 * To subscribe, send this :
 
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 152,
  "method": "public/get_historical_data",
  "params": {
    "instrument_name": "BTC_PERPETUAL",
    "begin_timestamp": 1615634726030296,
    "end_timestamp": 1615721186053261
  }
}



 
 
# Limitations 

  * If the program  is stopped and restarted, the program cant request the D. servers to fill the market data missing during down-time. The D. API does not support it.
  * There is no control about disk space.
  * The IO thread assignement per instrument does not check if instruments are related. This can lead to functionnal un-desirable behaviour like processing a price change for an instrument AFTER processing price change for options on this main instrument. Happily, the arch can allow this change very easily. See DataStore.cs:78

# Thanks to

  * https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp : used for websocket connectivity. 
  * https://json2csharp.com/ : used to convert quickly json samples to c# classes
  * NewtonSoft.JSon : used for de/serial




# TODO tech
  * Uses a real logger instead of Console.WriteLine
  * Adds try/catch for some critical blocks to avoid zombie threads.
  * Compress market data : use tick data to compress the fat decimal serial. Usually, price/tick_size fits in a 32b int, sometimes 24.
  * Add interfaces to ease testing (almost  everywhere)
  * Implement WebSocketMgr with strategies to handle providers request limits
  * Robustify AsyncController : use Interlocked to figure out the precise step of the start or stop workflows.
  * Add disk space control + hysteresis-based notifications when disk is almost full
  * Configure data store folder or even better : a file abstraction to handle several files per instrument (storage by day/month ?)
